# Jopagu's Fangame Toolkit

This project is built for renex engine, and Gamemaker 8.2.
You can download the renex engine fork to get a fresh engine with my stuff already installed.
Otherwise, you can download the individual files and add them to an existing project.

Documentation can be found in the folders.

If you use any of this for a project, I'd appreciate credit.
You can DM me on discord at Jopagu#4728 to let me know when you're working on something with these tools!
I'd appreciate keeping in touch and letting me know if you find any bugs. I can also help you use the tools,
and you can let me know if you have any feature requests.

Good luck and enjoy using my tools!

Huge thanks to Renex for creating GM8.2, renex engine, for code help, and for allowing me to distribute a fork of his engine.
